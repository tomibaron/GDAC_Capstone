What do you hope to take away from this capstone project? What is one important skill you think youâ€™ll learn?
For this case study, I expect to integrate and remember the contents I've seen throughout the course. I hope to stick to the knowledge and find motivation to complete future projects.
Which skills do you most look forward to demonstrating?
Clear and thoughtful creation of data visualizations and plots. Basic yet precise handling of datasets with spreadsheets/SQL/R Studio.
What are some issues you might encounter?
Definitely lack of motivation and failing to remember lots of the viewed content.
